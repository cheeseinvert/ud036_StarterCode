# Movie Trailer Website Project

This is my modified starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this webapp is to present a group of movie posters and trailers, meeting requirements from the review rubric here: [Project Specification](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2/view)

## Quickstart

To use my the Movie Trailer app right away:

* install python and clone this project locally
* change directory into the project folder and launch the webbrowser with `python entertainment_center.py`

## Important

This project was forked from this starter code [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud036_StarterCode)

## Contributing

The parent repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
